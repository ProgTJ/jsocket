Summary
----------

JSocket was developed with those who create TCP servers using Java in mind. This package includes classes that allow users to send whole strings, objects, and can transfer any file type of arbitrary size. These classes have most of the grunt work done to make as simple as calling a single method. To see how it is used: click the link in the "How to Use" section.

Credit
-------------

The ObjectSocket class is functional partly due to Google's [Gson package for Java](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/). This package is great for converting any object to JSON and vice versa.
