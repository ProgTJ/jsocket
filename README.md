Summary
----------

JSocket was developed to make socket programming in Java simpler. JSocket currently only focuses on TCP connections. What makes this library useful is that it makes cross-platform and cross-language TCP connections easier to deal with on the Java side. This library attempts to ensure clean messages come through that come from another platform/language. In some instances, say C# client -> Java server, a "dirty" message will come through. The Jsocket library can clean the message and return to a developer the correct message. This library includes various feature that can send anything from a simple string to a complex object. Features also include RSA encryption. Generate your own private and public keys.

The ObjectSocket class is functional partly due to Google's [Gson package for Java](https://code.google.com/p/google-gson/). This package is great for converting any object to JSON and vice versa.
